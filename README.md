## Troubleshooting Tips

-  Make sure you are using the latest version of chisel-nbdev with `pip install -U chisel-nbdev`
-  It is important for you to spell the name of your user and repo correctly in `settings.ini` or the website will not have the correct address from which to source assets like CSS for your site.  When in doubt, you can open your browser's developer console and see if there are any errors related to fetching assets for your website due to an incorrect URL generated by misspelled values from `settings.ini`.
-  If you change the name of your repo, you have to make the appropriate changes in `settings.ini`
-  After you make changes to `settings.ini`, run `chisel_nbdev_build_lib && chisel_nbdev_clean_nbs && chisel_nbdev_build_docs` to make sure all changes are propagated appropriately.
